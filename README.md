## üìä Data Collection & Preprocessing

- Used three photoresistors with RGB filter papers for ADC conversion.
- Collected `30 samples` for each of the `7 color classes`.
- Data was printed and stored via Putty.

### Preprocessing Steps

- Compute mean and standard deviation for each feature.
- Normalize data to improve learning efficiency.

## Maschine Learning

### **Forward Propagation**:
    - RGB sensor data is normalized and fed into the network.
    - Data flows through hidden layers to the output layer, where each neuron calculates a weighted sum and applies an activation function.
    - The Sigmoid function maps values to a range between 0 and 1, representing the probability of each color class.

### **Backward Propagation**:
    - Compute the error between prediction and target.
    - Propagate the error backward from output to hidden layers.
    - Adjust weights based on the calculated error.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Operating Principle

### ‚û°Forward Propagation

### ‚¨ÖBackward Propagation

### Training Process

- Load and normalize data, initialize weights.
- Loop through training cycles with forward and backward passes.
- Track accuracy and error every few cycles.

### 4. Real-Time Prediction

- Once trained, the network switches to live mode.
- Sensor reads RGB ‚Üí normalize ‚Üí run prediction ‚Üí display color result.
